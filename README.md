Instant Music - Play music instantly on your Chrome Browser.
=========

What is Instant Music?
-------------
Instant Music is a chrome extension that lets you listen to mainstream music in your favorite genre without having to open another heavy music player. You don't even need to come up with your own playlist because Instant Music automatically pulls famous music charts from iTunes, BillBoard, and Melon, and plays songs using YouTube videos as source. If there is any song you wish to play, you can search for it by the song's title and the artist's name, and watch it appears in your playlist instantly. And yes, of course you can create your own playlists too.

Contributing
============

Contributing to Instant Music is extremely easy because of the nature of a chrome extension. The backend is already taken care of, and all there is to care about is the frontend. The bugs usually stem from silent patches from YouTube or slight link modifications of music charts and other API's. I built Instant Music when I knew nothing about Backbone.js, and so little about JavaScript. If you have some experience with either of them, you can probably help!
